# My Neovim settings

_Updated: January 1, 2023_

## Overview

These are my latest Neovim configuration files. They include two files, settings.lua and keymaps.lua.

- settings.lua - this is where most of my core commands exist, including the most basic setup options for (n)vim.
- keymaps.lua - this is where I do all my remaps

## Philosophy

The idea for my Neovim (which I just call Vim) config is simplicity with a bit of spice where possible. Here are the main characteristics.

- Space for Leader
- "jk" for ESCAPE
- Wrapping by default (because I write a lot in Vim)
- Linebreak by default (see above)
- 4 spaces for tabs
- 4 spaces for indentsj
- No swapfiles
- Unlimited undo
- Ignore case in search
- Smartcase in search
